       <p style="background-color:thistle; font-size:30px; color:black;"> John Berger created a short series called ‚ÄúWays of Seeing‚Äù on BBC about the different ways of looking at oil paintings and how to approach and analyze them. There are four main categories that Berger breaks down in his series. The four categories are the use of cameras with painting, the way nude is approached for women in the painting, the value of the painting, and the publicity of the painting. The value of oil painters is under-appreciated today. The way that Berger breaks down each category of oil paintings helps the audience understand how important these paintings were in the past and present day. Each of these categories made me feel a greater appreciation for oil painting before watching this four-part series. Berger goes into more detail about these four categories to help the viewer understand the paintings. </p>


      <p style="background-color:thistle; font-size:30px; color:black;"> Berger talks about the way the cameras change the perspective from viewing the painting from the camera focusing on one subject rather than a whole. This makes me as an audience feel the connection of one person when the camera zooms into the subject. The intensity of the painting is more personal when it's up close to your face. He brings up a great point that music and voiceover can be used to narrate a painting to tell a story. This honestly amazed me because I have always watched movies that show old paintings and have a narrator talking over the paintings to tell a story. There is something about old paintings that changes my mind about the feeling of the painting when it's told through a narrative perspective. The audience cannot reply to the series but can visually watch the moving images on the screen. This is a great point because the audience and I can‚Äôt physically touch the pictures, but Berger can because he is near the photos, and we are not. Berger brings up a great point that oil paintings and photographs can be seductive. I do agree with this statement because a person's eyes can be drawn to the painting of a naked male and female.</p>

      <p style="background-color:thistle; font-size:30px; color:black;"> Berger goes into how women's bodies are approached in oil paintings back in the earlier days. He goes into that nakedness is created in the mind of the person that is thinking about the women in the oil painting. I do agree with this statement because every man will fantasize about a woman when they see a naked photo of them in a painting, magazine, or billboard. He stresses that the naked women in the paintings make men judge the women‚Äôs bodies. This scene is unfair from the viewer‚Äôs perspective because we are judging the women in the oil painting based on their bodies and looks. As a viewer, I felt very uncomfortable watching this episode because women should be appreciated for their personalities. Berger explains to the audience that woman should not be objectified for the way they look and should not be looked at as just sexual beings. Women are being influenced by constant images of women shown sexually in magazines, oil paintings, and even photos on social media. This can affect their mental health or how they want to be treated by society. It is very sad to hear that many women are treated with disrespect by men who think they can dominate and control them. For instance, in one of the paintings, the man was standing straight and tall, whereas the woman was leaning on him. This represents the man is the dominant figure and the woman is leaning over him.</p>

      <p style="background-color:thistle; font-size:30px; color:black;"> Berger transitions over from talking about nude oil paintings to how consumers value oil paintings. He goes into how some patrons in the 17th century were able to afford oil paintings to hang in their houses to admire them and appreciate the value of the painting. I truly find it amazing that paintings were hung up in people's houses to look at them for hours and hours on end. These people's imaginations must have gone wild as they are looking at the oil painting to create a story about the painting and what it represents to them. I find this very amazing because the value of a painting can be worth millions of dollars still today. Paintings in the MoMa in NYC are still taken care of today to keep the value of the paintings for the next century. When I‚Äôm in an art gallery, I can truly appreciate the colors, the environment, and the lines of the painting rather than looking at it through a tv or computer screen. Berger brings up a great point of looking deeper into a painting that can have more meaning than just reading a book. He goes into how a viewer like him can evaluate the painting of the woman holding pearls in a dark room with minimum light in it. I can look at this painting myself and see the little details without the camera zooming into it.</p>

      <p style="background-color:thistle; font-size:30px; color:black;">Publicity is the attention of the audience by the media, for instance, oil paintings and photographs. Berger goes into how glamorous the process of manifesting publicity is. This fact is true because the audience can see the quality and the way it was painted in front of them when they view the painting. Publicity can set setting, pleasure, and gestures through the viewer's eyes and bodies. The feeling of chills going down your body and your heart racing when a male sees a naked woman or a wide-open field with animals, trees and the sun shining down can make a person appreciate the painting. The anxiety of the naked women can cause excitement for the male perspective. It‚Äôs amazing to see the coloration and the way the oil paintings are presented without any context to them. The world of reality becomes unrecognizable when oil paintings and photographs are shown to the public. This makes the audience question the painting of the artists of them having the subject in front of them while they were painting. I feel that half of these oil paintings that Berger shows us are not real and are made up of the artists' imaginations. All these oil paintings are judged by our imagination and the audience can come up with their conclusion of the story behind the paintings. The viewers need to understand how the painting is created and who created it to understand its worth, and publicity can help with that. Overall, Berger evaluates the way oil painting should be viewed and appreciated through the viewers eyes. </p>
